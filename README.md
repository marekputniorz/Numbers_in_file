# Numbers_in_file

## What you find in this repository:
* input file - NUMBERS.txt
* my program

## Introduction 

It was my project in my exam from programming on High school. Program is very simple to use. First you need the input file which you find in the repository too under the name NUMBERS.txt. In this .txt file you find some numbers from 10 to 80. Then you need my program. 

## How is it working?
Program will ask you on the input file which is NUMBERS.txt or any other file with numbers. Then programm will ask you on output file. There you write the name of your output file. The name of output file doesn't matter because when you write something program will automaticly make the file with the name you type. After program stops you can go to your file explorer and in the same path where you have my program and also the input file there must be also the newly made output file. When you click on the output file you will find the something like **sum of numbers in the input file is** and the number of the sum. 

## Warning!
You need input file in the same path where is the program for counting the numbers!
